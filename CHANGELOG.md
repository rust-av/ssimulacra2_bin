## Version 0.3.4

- Add `--frame-threads` argument to support frame parallel multithreading
  - This is set to 1 by default because it does linearly increase memory usage

## Version 0.3.3

- Fix graphing

## Version 0.3.2

- Use crossterm instead of termion for Windows compatibility

## Version 0.3.1

## Version 0.3.0

- Implement upstream changes from https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/pull/1848

## Version 0.2.2

- Fix decoding of AV1 files with overlays when using `ffmpeg_build` feature
  - Or at least attempt to. There still seems to be some flakiness with linking libdav1d.

## Version 0.2.0

- Add support for video comparison
- This change splits ssimulacra2_rs into two subcommands:
  - `ssimulacra2_rs image input.png output.png` for comparing still images. All popular input formats are supported.
  - `ssimulacra2_rs video input.y4m output.y4m` for comparing videos. All popular input formats are supported. This feature requires the `ffmpeg` feature be enabled, which is on by default.
