Binary interface to the Rust implementation of the SSIMULACRA2 metric: https://github.com/rust-av/ssimulacra2

## Quality Guidelines

The following is a rough estimate of how ssimulacra2 scores correspond to visual quality.

- 30 = low quality. This corresponds to the p10 worst output of mozjpeg -quality 30.
- 50 = medium quality. This corresponds to the average output of cjxl -q 40 or mozjpeg -quality 40, or the p10 output of cjxl -q 50 or mozjpeg -quality 60.
- 70 = high quality. This corresponds to the average output of cjxl -q 65 or mozjpeg -quality 70, p10 output of cjxl -q 75 or mozjpeg -quality 80.
- 90 = very high quality. Likely impossible to distinguish from the original when viewed at 1:1 from a normal viewing distance. This corresponds to the average output of mozjpeg -quality 95 or the p10 output of cjxl -q 

## Required packages for video support:

### Arch

```bash
sudo pacman -S vapoursynth vapoursynth-plugin-lsmashsource gcc make cmake pkg-config ttf-bitstream-vera # Keep install dependencies
```

### Other Linux

See http://www.vapoursynth.com/doc/installation.html#linux-installation

Install l-smash from https://github.com/l-smash/l-smash
Install LSMASHSource VapourSynth plugin from https://github.com/AkarinVS/L-SMASH-Works

### Windows

Do not install or download any pre-release.
1) Follow Vapoursynth's installation step http://www.vapoursynth.com/doc/installation.html#windows-installation (Not the portable installation)
   - If you intend to install Vapoursynth system-wide instead of local, Python will also need to be system-wide. 
3) Get latest version of `VapourSynth-x64-R##.exe`
4) Run the .exe file to install VapourSynth, don't modify or change any setting if you are not familar with it
5) After Vapoursynth is installed, find its path
   1. Local - `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\VapourSynth\`
   2. System-wide - `C:\VapourSynth\` or `C:\Program Files\VapourSynth`
7) Then download the latest release-x86_64-cachedir-cwd.zip from https://github.com/AkarinVS/L-SMASH-Works/releases/tag/latest
8) Decompress the release-x86_64-cachedir-cwd.zip, copy and paste the libvslsmashsource.dll to `C:\Path\to\VapourSynth\plugins\`
9) Install Rust from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
10) Open Powershell and run `rustc --version` to check if it has been installed
11) Copy the full path `C:\Path\to\VapourSynth\sdk\lib64`
12) Enter the command on Powershell with the copied path: `$env:LIB="C:\Path\to\VapourSynth\sdk\lib64;$env:LIB"`
13) Then enter `cargo install ssimulacra2_rs`
14) If it fails because it requires Visual Studio or Visual Studio Tools, you can download either of them.
    1. Download from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
    2. Find the "Tools for Visual Studio" bar and download the "Remote Tools for Visual Studio 2022".
    3. Make sure Desktop Development with C++ is checked, leave the optional check installation alone and download it.
    4. Retry step 10 again after you reboot your PC.
15) Run `ssimulacra2_rs -h` to check if it's running.
16) You're done!
